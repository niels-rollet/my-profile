				  	<h2>Weightlifting</h2>
				  	<p>My principal hobby is weightlifting. I started this practice 1 year ago in order to take weight and self-confidence. Today it's an automatism to go to the gym that I include in my routine 5 times a week.

				  	<h2>Video Games</h2>
				  	<p>I also like video games. I started playing video games in my very youth with friends after school, and today I still play when I have the time of course with some of the friends I mentioned.

				  	<h2>Car</h2>
				  	<p>I love sports and luxury cars. I do not have of course but it would be my to be the owner of a beautiful car later and this since very small. Indeed, I have a lot of knowledge in the automotive field and I read a lot about it.

				  	<h2>Music</h2>
				  	<p>And now let's talk about one of my last passion, the music. I always listen to music. When I'm in the gym, when I cook, when I shower, when I drive, ALWAYS. I like any kind of music, when I'm studying for example I listen to Classical music, when I'm driving Rap and when I'm training I listen to Hardstyle.
